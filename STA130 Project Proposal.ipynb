We use the equation, Y=β0+β1X+ϵ, where Y is life satisfaction, β0 is the y-intercept or expected value of Y when X is 0, β1 is the slope, X is age, and ϵ is error term. I will fit the linear regression model to my data and then calculate the predicted values for life satisfaction for each observation in the dataset. By looking at the coefficients and R-squared I can determine the strength and direction between age and life satisfaction, including proportion of variance in the life satisfaction explained by the age. We assume that there is a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variable."

If the R-squared is closer to 1 then a significant proportion of the variation in life satisfaction is explained by age. If it is closer to 0, age does not explain much of the variation in life satisfaction. These results are relevant to answering the research question as it shows the relationship between age and life satisfaction."
