    "1. **Difference between Simple and Multiple Linear Regression**: We clarified that simple linear regression involves one predictor variable, while multiple linear regression involves two or more predictors, providing a more nuanced model of relationships by capturing interactions and more complex associations between variables.\n",

    "2. **Using Continuous and Indicator Variables**: We explored how using a continuous predictor (e.g., spending amount) differs from an indicator (binary) variable (e.g., \"high\" or \"low\" spending) in regression models. We highlighted how continuous variables provide a gradient of predictions, whereas indicator variables lead to categorical distinctions.\n",

    "3. **Linear Predictions (Log-Odds)**:\n",
    "   - **Linear predictions** refer to the **log-odds** (the raw output of the model) before they are transformed into probabilities using the logistic function.\n",
    "   - The **log-odds** are calculated as a linear combination of the predictor values, and can be interpreted as how much the **logarithmic odds** of the outcome change with each predictor.\n",
    "   - To get the linear predictions (log-odds), you use the `model.predict(new_data, linear=True)` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Making Predictions**:\n",
    "   - After fitting the model, you can use `model.predict()` to predict probabilities for new data.\n",

Having R^2 be 17.6%, that means only about 17.6% of the variance in HP can be accounted for by the model. The low R^2 value indicates that While it captures some of the variance, other factors might be influencing HP. The other statement \"Many of the coefficients are larger than 10 while having strong or very strong evidence against the null hypothesis of 'no effect'\", refers to the coefficients estimates and their statistical significance. Larger coefficients indicate that the independent variables have a larger effect on the dependent variable. Therefore the two statements contradicts each other because low R^2 means the model doesn't explain much of the variation in the data but large coefficients with strong statistical significance show that individual variables in the model do have a significant relationship with the dependent variable."

    "For the results of this demonstration, we get an in-sample R-squared that tells us how well the model fits the training data -- How much of the variation in the dependent variable can be explained by the predictors. Tge out-of-sample R-squared measures the models predictive power based on the testing data -- indicating how well the model generalizes the data that was unseen in the training. This shows the variability and reliability of the models performance, and the purpose was to see how well the model generalizes to unseen data, representing real-world scenarios. "

    "\n",
    "1. **For Loop to Generate Model Metrics**: We started by discussing how to create a `for` loop that generates, collects, and visualizes paired \"in-sample\" and \"out-of-sample\" R-squared performance metrics for a regression model over 100 iterations using randomly split data without setting a fixed random seed. This helps assess model generalization and stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Explanation of Results**: I explained the meaning of the in-sample and out-of-sample R-squared metrics, why their variability across iterations is important, and how they can reveal patterns of overfitting, underfitting, or robust model behavior. We also discussed the purpose of demonstrating these repeated splits to evaluate model performance and generalization capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handling NameError Issue**: You encountered a `NameError` due to an undefined `songs` dataset. I explained that the error arises because the dataset wasn't defined or loaded and provided steps to load a dataset properly using `pandas`. I also offered a simple example of creating a dummy dataset if you didn't have a `songs` dataset available.\n",
    "\n",
    "This session focused on understanding model evaluation techniques, interpreting metrics, and debugging errors related to data loading. If you have any further questions or need additional help, feel free to ask!\""

    "In the code, model7_gen1_predict_future and model6_gen1_predict_future are linear regression models that create models based on a specified formula, in this case, model7_linear_form or model6_linear_form. The code is fitted to using data from only Generation 1 Pokemon through the code pokeaman[pokeaman.Generation==1]. The models model7_gen1to5_predict_future and model6_gen1to5_predict_future are similar but instead of using only Generation 1 Pokemon they use data from Generation 1 to 5. The line of code for in-sample R-squared prints the R-squared values for the original model's fit and for the new models, in-sample R-squared indicates how well the model explains the variance of the data it was trained on while the out-of-sample R-squared shows the models predictive accuracy using different test data. Splitting the data into different generations test if models built on certain Pokémon generations hold up for others by splitting the data into different groups. The models model7 and model6 represent different formulas or versions of regression models, and by comparing the performance of these models, we can determine which approach better predicts Pokémon stats across generations. The use of actual and predicted values to calculate R-squared show if the model captures meaningful patterns or just fits its training data."
